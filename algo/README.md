# Algorithm

## Run Program

### `python solution.py`

## Algorithm Description

We will split target into 2 parts and set key, value for both 2 parts in dict.
If key in word_list then check the value of `wordlist.count(key)` and `dict[key]`
If both values are equal return both 2 split parts

## Complexity

O(n*m)

n is len of target and m is len of word_list
